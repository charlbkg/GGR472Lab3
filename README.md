### GGR472 Lab 3: Adding styling and interactivity with JavaScript

## Main goals and components of site:

# I used this lab to continue working on the resume web map site I created in previous labs. 
# Some of the major changes from the site's previous versions are the addition of event handlers 
# fly from experience to experience using buttons. I also added popups with descriptions of the 
# experience. To interact with the map on a larger extent, and to practice classifying data, I
# added a button that zooms out to reveal a layer of polygons for states/provinces I have lived
# in. I classified the polygons by years I lived in that state/province and added a legend to 
# help contextualize this data. For the experience data, I set the symbols to dissapear when 
# zoomed out to the full extent, and set the province/state data to dissapear when zoomed in on
# a specific city. 

## Challenges and future goals for the site:

# There are some remaining issues with the site to be fixed in the future. I am struggling to 
# change the color of the legend text. I am also struggling with the functionality of the 
# bootstrap navbar, and will have to fix this before I add content for the second page. For 
# the second page, I am hoping to add a portfolio of the maps I've made throughout university.
# To do this, I'll have to gain a better understanding of bootstrap image formatting. I will 
# also consider different ways to add contextual information to the maps, potentially titles
# or popups.
